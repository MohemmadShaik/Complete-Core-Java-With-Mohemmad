 7. Operators

Symbols that tell compiler to perform some operation.

Eg : int sum = a + b; // Here a and b  ---> operands and '+' ---> operator

 Arithmetic Operators
 ====================

     Binary                                       Unary 
     (Here we use 2 operands)              (Here we use only one operand)
      Let's say A= 10 and B=5            
       +  --> A + B = 10 + 5 =15                      ++  
       -  --> A - B = 10 - 5 =5                       --
       *  --> A * B = 10 * 5 =50
       /  --> A / B = 10 / 5 =2
       %(modulo) --> A % B = 10 % 5 =0


Unary Operators
===============
To increase or decrease the operand value by 1 we use unary operators 
Eg:  a++ or ++a or a = a+1 // Here a value is 1 

Here a is a operand and the value of a will increase by 1 

Pre Increment (before)           Post Increment (after)
 ++a                                 a++
 1. first value changes             1. first value is used
 2. later value gets used           2. later value is changed
