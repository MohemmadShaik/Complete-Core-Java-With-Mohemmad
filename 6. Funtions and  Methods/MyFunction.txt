11. Function/Methods
========================

A reusable block of code/statements which is written once and can be 
called any no.of times as per the user need without re-writing the same logic of code again and again.

syntax: 
=======
returnType name(){
    //body
    return statement;
}

NOTE : If we write any function within a class then those functions are called as methods in java.
KEY NOTE : Like other langauges (C, C++ , Python) we can write functions outside the class (which are Called as Standalone functions) 
           but Java programmming is designed in such a way that all functions should be written within the classes only.

//Program 1:

public class MyFunction {
    public static void printHelloWorld() {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        return;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        printHelloWorld();//function call

    }

}
