11. Function/Methods
========================

A reusable block of code/statements which is written once and can be 
called any no.of times as per the user need without re-writing the same logic of code again and again.

syntax: 
=======
returnType name(){
    //body
    return statement;
}

NOTE : If we write any function within a class then those functions are called as methods in java.
KEY NOTE : Like other langauges (C, C++ , Python) we can write functions outside the class (which are Called as Standalone functions) 
           but Java programmming is designed in such a way that all functions should be written within the classes only.
           We can write any no.of functions within a single class.

//Program 1:

public class MyFunction {
    public static void printHelloWorld() {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        return;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        printHelloWorld();//function call

    }

}

======================================================================

//Program 2: Addition of 2 numbers using function

Note : Here we will break this program into 3 parts 

Part 1 : Program to calculate Sum of 2 numbers (i.e without using function)
Part 2 : Program to calculate Sum of 2 numbers without using any return type and without passing any arguments.
Part 3 : Program to calculate Sum of 2 numbers with return type and passing the arguments.
 
 //PART 1 : Program to calculate Sum of 2 numbers (i.e without using function)
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MyFunction {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter  a value : ");
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter  b value : ");
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int sum = a + b;
        System.out.println("Sum is : "+sum);

        sc.close();// close the scanner to avoid resource leaks
    }
 }

 //PART 2 : Program to calculate Sum of 2 numbers without using any return type and without passing any arguments.

 import java.util.Scanner;

public class MyFunction {

    public static void calculateSum() {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a value : ");
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter b value : ");
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int sum = a + b;
        System.out.println("Sum of " + a + " and " + b + " is : " + sum);
        sc.close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        calculateSum();
    }
}
